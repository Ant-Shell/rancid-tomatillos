## Challenges

- Anthony: This was a fun project! It was awesome using an external API to fetch movie data that continuously updates. Utilizing Swiper was a cool feature for displaying movie cards and trailers. I think our implementation of Router and some of our conditional rendering could be improved upon, but overall I am happy with the result!  

- Will: This was my first time writing in React, so it was a bit of a learning curve. Swiper was new to both of us, and I'm glad we took on the challenge to make it look much better. Learning how to Route properly also took a bit of time to get correct, but was also a great learning experience.
